## 🧠 Philosophy

ChronoTrack is built for:

* **Developers** who prefer the terminal
* **Writers & makers** who want data on their workflow
* Anyone who values **clarity over clutter**

No web dashboard. No sync. Just clean terminal insights.

---

## ⚠️ Cautions / Notes

* Always **stop a session** before starting a new one.
* Breaks are session-specific — you must start a task first.
* If you force quit during a pause, the session may be left in a "paused" state.
* Be consistent with your tags for clean summaries.

---

## 📁 Data Format (session\_log.json)

Each session is stored like:

```json
{
  "task": "Write blog post",
  "tag": "writing",
  "start": "2025-05-13T12:30:00",
  "end": "2025-05-13T13:45:00",
  "duration_minutes": 65.0,
  "breaks": [
    {"start": "2025-05-13T13:00:00", "end": "2025-05-13T13:05:00", "duration_minutes": 5.0}
  ],
  "total_breaks": 1,
  "total_break_time": 5.0,
  "note": "Felt very focused",
  "note_added": true
}
```

---

## 💾 Export Logs

```bash
chronotrack export json
chronotrack export csv
```

Output files will be saved as `export.json` or `export.csv`.
